/// Phase 135 integration coverage: a page reload always constructs a fresh
/// MockRideRealtime, whose subscribe() used to unconditionally reset to
/// findingDriver and restart the 25-second assignment timer - regardless of
/// what the restored ride's real status was.
///
/// The exact bug/fix mechanism (a stale low-versioned reset event wrongly
/// accepted because RideSession.authoritativeVersion was never seeded) is
/// reproduced deterministically at the unit level in
/// test/booking/ride_session_reconcile_test.dart's "Phase 135" group - that
/// test genuinely fails against the old (unseeded) call and passes against
/// the fix, with no timing dependency. These tests are the integration
/// layer on top: they drive the real RideRestoreCoordinator.pageFor +
/// WaitingForDriver + MockRideRealtime.primeResume path end to end and
/// confirm the resumed ride's status is correct immediately and stays
/// stable past the mock's assignment window. They do not independently
/// reproduce the original bug against unmodified code: a fresh broadcast
/// StreamController silently drops an event added before subscribe()'s own
/// caller has attached its listener, so the pre-fix reset-to-findingDriver
/// emit never actually reached DriverTrackingController in this harness
/// either - which is also why the resume path's own initial emit had to be
/// deferred by a microtask (see subscribe()'s scheduleMicrotask) to work at
/// all here.
///
/// Covers the same two scenarios the Batch 10 audit manually drove in a
/// headless browser: reload mid-approach (driver assigned, not yet arrived)
/// and reload mid-trip.
